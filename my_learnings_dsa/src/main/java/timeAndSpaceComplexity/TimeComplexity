What is time complexity ?
	1) Time complexity is not equal to the time taken by the code to run.
	2) It is the rate at the which the time taken increases with respect to the input size.\
	3) We denote the time taken in the big o notations, or omega notations or theta notations.
	
	for(int i = 0 ; i<n;i++){
		for(int j = 0; j<=n; j++){
			sysout("Hey")
		}
	}
	
what is space complexity?

	1) Space complexity is the combination of auxiliary space and input space.
	2) Auxiliary space is the space which we use to solve the problem.
	3) Input space is the space which we use to store the input.
